# SPEMLBC_1stProj_Linear_Price_vs._Rig

Hello everyone!
I have completed the repository for our 1st project_linear modelling.

# Project Goal:
Build a linear model between US Rotary Rigs count and Spot price, (put away time series analysis for later)

# Data Source:
EIA.gov, more specifically, https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MCRFPUS2&f=M

# Techniques to be used:
Linear modelling (regression), supervised learning and optional Regularization methods, including Ridge and Lasso.


Upon receiving the structure file from our mentor Alan Mcdonald's, I have re-organized the whole directories and roles according to：
1） Business Analyst:
  Expected to be data visualization coding and decision making;
2) Data Engineer:
  Expected to do data fetching and cleaning, I have placed the optional data list and API utilities at a separate folder called "data_list" and a subfolder "utilities"
3) Data Scientist:
  Expected to do mathematical modelling and learning rate optimization, need to present R^2 and Pearson Correlation Value
  

Simply fork, clone the code to your local git directory and modify it as you wish, after you are done, make a pull request and I will test the code.

# PLEASE REMEMBER THE FOLLOWING:
PLEASE DO BRANCHING FIRST after cloning to your local machine and updated it.
We can have a discussion on the new features and decide whether we want to merge it onto the master branch.
